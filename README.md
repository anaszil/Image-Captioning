# Image-Captioning

* Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image
* It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions.

In this Notebook we present our model trained using data :
* train images http://msvocds.blob.core.windows.net/coco2014/train2014.zip
* validation images http://msvocds.blob.core.windows.net/coco2014/val2014.zip
* captions for both train and validation http://msvocds.blob.core.windows.net/annotations-1-0-3/captions_train-val2014.zip
